# CheatSheets

This repo is small project that is a central place for the most common commands used for systems we may use in work/projects.

It can allow new starters to contribute to projects on Github and get used to Git tools and commands. 

You dont really need any coding experience as this is more of a documentation project, so no stress. So please feel free contribute anytime you can, I appreciate it.

I am still learning about Github and Git myself and want to get involved in the opensource community more, so please feel free to give any advice or reccomendation via an issue.

Sub category:

  #Quick explanation of command.
    Command

e.g

Linux/Unix:

  #List files and Directories.
    ls
      #Options include.
        -l = List
        -h = Human readable file/directory size
        etc
                
        
  #List files in a list, shows file size in humnan readable format and shows hidden files.
    ls -lha


Looking at the example above the category/sub category name ends in a colon, then the command description is idented 1 tab (8 Spaces) below. The command itself is then indented 2 tabs (16 Spaces), the options title if applicable is idented 3 tabs (24 Spaces) and the options themselves idented 4 tabs (32 Spaces).

This is how the layout should be for the listed commands etc.
