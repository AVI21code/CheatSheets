# CheatSheets

This repo is small project to allow new starters to contribute to projects on Github and get used to Git tools and commands. 
Is is a central place for most common commands used for systems we may use in work/projects.
I am still learning about Github and Git myself so what better way to get involved with the opensuource community and give something back.
You dont really need any coding experience as this is more of a documentation project, so no stress.

There are a few rule to follow though ;)
