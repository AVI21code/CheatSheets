# CheatSheets

This repo is small project to allow new starters to contribute to projects on Github and get used to Git tools and commands. 
It is a central place for the most common commands used for systems we may use in work/projects.

You dont really need any coding experience as this is more of a documentation project, so no stress.
I am still learning about Github and Git myself so what better way to get involved with the opensource community and give something back.

So please feel free contribute what ever time you can, I appreciate it.

There are a few rules to follow though ;)

High level Steps include:

1. Cloning the repo - https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository
2. Create your branch - https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches
3. Make your changes
4. Commit them with a quick message of what was added - https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/git-commit
6. Push your branch with changes for a PR - "Almighty Push" ;)

--------------------------------------------------

Please have a look to see if the categories are already added per file and add your changes there, please do not duplicate already added entries.

The structure should be as followed.

Sub category:

  #Quick explanation of command.
    Command

e.g

Linux/Unix:

  #List files and Directories.
    ls
      #Options include.
        -l = List
        -h = Human readable file/Direcory size
        etc
                
        
  #List files in a list, shows file size in humnan readable format and shows hidden files.
    ls -lha


Looking at the example above the category/sub category name ends in a colon, then the command desription is idented 1 space bellow. The command itself is then idented 2 spaces, the option title if applicable idented 3 spaces and the options themselves idented 4 spaces.

This is how the layout should be for the listed
