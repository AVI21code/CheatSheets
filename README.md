# CheatSheets

This repo is small project to allow new starters to contribute to projects on Github and get used to Git tools and commands. 
Is is a central place for the most common commands used for systems we may use in work/projects.
You dont really need any coding experience as this is more of a documentation project, so no stress.
I am still learning about Github and Git myself so what better way to get involved with the opensuource community and give something back.
So please feel free contribute what ever time you can, I appreciate it.
